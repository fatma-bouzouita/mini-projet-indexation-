Beauty can be defined as a quality in someone or something that makes it attractive and interesting in our eyes. The famous English saying goes, “Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.”
Beauty is a quality that makes us feel a sense of pleasure and appreciation.
As it solely depends on how ‘WE’ see beauty, there can never be an external standard of beauty.
Often when we standardize the norms of beauty, we create unhealthy comparison, competition and jealousy among people.
    Beauty is not at all about outward appearance, but deeper human qualities, like kindness, compassion and so on.
    Nature teaches us that beauty is hidden in everything, including hard rocks and wild weeds.
    Beauty inspires creativity and art in human beings.
    Beauty is present in every human. We just need to look deeper for it.

Poet John Keats had once written, “A Thing of Beauty is a Joy Forever.” It tells us that when we are able to see beauty in something or someone, we also feel positive feelings such as joy, happiness and gratefulness.

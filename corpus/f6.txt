Water pollution changes the quality of the water. This disrupts the balance of the ecosystem and poses health risks. Water is polluted by the presence or addition of inorganic and organic or biological substances. Industrial effluents that are discharged into rivers further increase the levels of water pollution.     

Soil pollution usually results from the elimination of solid and semi-solid wastes from agricultural practices and unhealthy habits. The soil is heavily polluted by hazardous materials and micro-organisms that enter the food chain or water and create many health problems. 

The present issue is that it is increasing day by day as a result of many polluting sources. Humans and human-created machines are of contaminants. To put it another way, pollution is wreaking havoc on Mother Earth, and we, as humans, must do everything we can to prevent it. Pollution prevention is critical because it protects the environment by conserving and protecting natural resources while also boosting economic growth by allowing industry to produce more efficiently and reducing the amount of waste that needs to be handled by households, businesses, and communities.
